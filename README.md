# Lorenz-Attractor
Java program using Processing IDE to simulate and visualize the Lorenz attractor

The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by Edward Norton Lorenz, an American mathematician and meteorologist around 1963. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. It was derived from a simplified model of convection in the Earth's atmosphere. It also arises naturally in models of lasers and dynamos. The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or figure eight. The following image appeared in the Nature Journal on 31 August 2000, pp 949 as part of an article titled The Lorenz Attractor Exists, written by Ian Stewart.

The Lorenz attractor system is most commonly expressed as 3 coupled non-linear differential equations-
dx/dt=a(y−x)
dy/dt=x(b−z)−y
dz/dt=xy−cz
In the above set of equations, 'a' is sometimes known as the Prandtl number and 'b' the Rayleigh number. One commonly used set of constants is a = 10, b = 28, c = 8 / 3. Another is a = 28, b = 46.92, c = 4.
